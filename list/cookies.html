                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp white miso paste</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li> 1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>Dark chocolate of your choice</li>
            </ul>
        </br>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the butter to a saucepan over medium heat. Melt down and heat until browned.</li>
                <li>Pour the brown butter into a measuring glass and add the miso paste. Whisk to combine and set aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the sugar, dark brown sugar, and cooled miso brown butter. Whisk to combine.</li>
                <li>Add in the egg and vanilla and whisk vigorously until the mixture turns pale and creamy.</li>
                <li>Pour in the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to fold the two together. Right before the dry ingredients are fully mixed in, add in the chopped chocolate and fold to fully combine.</li>
                <li>Use a large 2 oz scoop or 1/4 measuring cup and scoop out the cookies.</li>
                <li>Then press the tops of the cookie dough balls into the sesame seeds so they cover the very tops of each cookie.</li>
                <li>Place 4 cookies on the baking sheet spaced a few inches apart. Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until the edges are a light golden brown and the centers look barely underdone.</li>
                <li>Allow the cookies to rest on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack and bake the remaining cookies.</li>
                <li>Let the cookies cool for about 20-30 minutes, then dig in! Enjoy!</li>
