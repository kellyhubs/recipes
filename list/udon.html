        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Udon noodles</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of mentsuyu/tsuyu (concentrated noodle soup base)</li>
            <li>2 1/3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1 green onion</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        </br>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Follow the instructions on your concentrated mentsuyu bottle for the correct mentsuyu-to-water dilution ratio for noodle soup broth.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, mentsuyu, and mirin. Bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Once simmering, remove the pot from the heat. Cover with a lid and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water comes to a full rolling boil, add the udon noodles and cook according to the package instructions. For fresh homemade udon, separate and untangle the strands of noodles with your hands, and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using chopsticks, stir the noodles so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>When the noodles are done cooking, drain them in a colander and cool under cold running water.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are cool enough to touch, use your hands to rinse them well under the cold running water to remove the starch and give the noodles a firm texture. Then, switch to hot running water to warm up the noodles; alternatively, you can heat them up in a pot of hot water.</li>
            <li>Serve the hot udon noodles in individual bowls. Pour the hot broth over the noodles and top with the chopped green onions and your choice of toppings.</li>
        </ol>
